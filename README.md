# SmartdoorAuthSystem
Arduino based system that helps them to make a login section for a door by Wi-Fi and solenoid lock

Introduction 
	smart wireless door lock that can be unlocked by your smartphone.
Using smartphones and smart devices it becomes easier and affordable for all people and it’s a good option for us to make our daily life smarter. 
Each day, new security systems and tools that you can make smarter environment by using them and create new ways to make your life safer and easier. you have seen smart locks for doors that have a keypad or use a fingerprint to set the door lock or unlock.
In this project, we want to make an Arduino based system that helps them to make a login section for a door by Wi-Fi and solenoid lock.
We don’t use keypad or complicated mechanical elements which is expensive and these are advantages of this system. We just stick a QR code to the door and the allowed people can scan it to see the login page and enter their password. After typing the correct password, the solenoid lock will be activated and the door will be unlocked.
